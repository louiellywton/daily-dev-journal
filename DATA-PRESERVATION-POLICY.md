# Data Preservation Policy for Daily Dev Journal

## Overview

This daily dev journal implements a **ZERO DELETION** policy for all historical data. Everything is preserved permanently for historical proof and long-term analysis, even decades into the future.

## Core Preservation Principles

### 1. NEVER DELETE PRINCIPLE

**NO DATA IS EVER DELETED** - Everything is preserved forever:
- Daily journal entries from day one
- Log files and execution history  
- Analytics reports and insights
- Performance metrics and benchmarks
- System health data and diagnostics
- Vector analytics and ML insights
- All generated reports and exports

### 2. ARCHIVE AND COMPRESS STRATEGY

Instead of deletion, we use a tiered storage approach:

**Tier 1: Active Data** (Recent entries, < 1 year)
- Stored in standard JSON format
- Full formatting and readability
- Immediate access for analytics
- Located in `/data/entries/`

**Tier 2: Archived Data** (1-5 years old)
- Consolidated into yearly archive files
- Both formatted and compressed versions
- Located in `/data/archives/`
- Format: `YYYY-archive.json` (readable) and `YYYY-compressed.json` (compact)

**Tier 3: Historical Archives** (5+ years old)  
- Multi-year consolidated archives
- Ultra-compressed format for long-term storage
- Preserved with full data integrity
- Automated integrity checks

**Tier 4: Log Archives**
- Daily logs compressed monthly after 90 days
- Monthly archives created for efficiency
- All execution history preserved
- Located in `/data/logs/archives/`

## Automated Preservation Schedule

### Daily Operations (Every Day at 9 WIB)
- Generate new entries and analytics
- Create daily logs and performance metrics
- Update statistics and insights
- **NO DATA REMOVAL**

### Monthly Operations (1st of each month)  
- Compress logs older than 90 days into monthly archives
- Create compressed report bundles for storage efficiency
- Validate data integrity across all tiers
- **ALL ORIGINALS PRESERVED**

### Annual Operations (January 1st)
- Archive entries older than 1 year into yearly collections
- Create both readable and compressed archive versions  
- Generate historical summary reports
- Perform comprehensive data validation
- **ZERO DATA LOSS GUARANTEE**
